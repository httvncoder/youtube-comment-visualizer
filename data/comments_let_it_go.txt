Disney copied this song so she should get payed more for copyright﻿
She looks like a moron in the thumbnail.
Fuck this bitch and her stupid ass "give your heart a break".  I was so 
happy when that old man on the X-factor made fun of her autotune.﻿
Okay so all this time I've been getting shit from conformist pop music 
fagots for being Emo while they themselves watch music videos with some 
spoiled white chick sitting all sad in a corner... Yeah, I'm the depressed 
one.....﻿
HEY MOTHER FUCKER MAKE YOUR OWN MUSIC BITCH﻿
2/10 still better than Bieber. ﻿
Frozen﻿
Every comment: OMFG U SUCK U FAT BITCH DIE DIE ELSAS BETTER
Me: I really liked this and demi is an awesome singer i love all of her 
songs﻿
WHORE DON'T FCKING STEAL SONGS :D﻿
She is so ugly ewwwww﻿
She is fat LOL xD ﻿
For all you haters out there,
Demi is a strong woman who love herself no matter what and that really 
takes courage, I'm sorry if you tried to raise your self-esteem by coming 
here to call her fat or ugly or that you hate her voice.That doesn't really 
work. But your kind of self hating trolls should just go take a look in a 
mirror and really think about what do you really want from life. Because 
calling someone fat is not going to make you thinner, calling someone 
stupid is not going to make you smarter and calling someone ugly is not 
going to make you any prettier.﻿
Demi Lovato - Let It Go (from "Frozen") [Official]﻿
Can anyone tell me the name of this song?﻿
HEARD THIS.......!!!! how many likes this???﻿
I am gonna be like what you said﻿
This is better than the original. Who agrees?﻿
None
Demi stole Elsa's furniture﻿
Am I the only one who instantly gets a headache when I listen to her sing?  
She's awful﻿
LOL﻿
I was one of those rare peeps who saw the awesome movie "Frozen" much later 
than released, and then was inundated with *other people's* version of this 
song in my social media feed and at home.  I found out Demi Lovato is the 
original singer just today by watching her latest vid, "Really Don't Care". 
 Also a good one.

Re-listening to this vid-tune....the lyrics speak straight from my heart!
"The cold never bothered me anyway"

Take that, #Coldheart!﻿
This is so soulless compared to the original :/ ﻿
Demi has a beautiful voice. Much better than that bitch who sings on the 
Frozen soundtrack. I've never seen the movie and I refuse to. I've heard 
the song sung by the other woman. Whoever thinks she actually sounds good 
is deaf.
Thank goodness for Demi to make a good version.﻿
idina menzel's version is a lot better﻿
I FRICKIN HATE LET IT GO AND DIMMI LAVTO﻿

Une de mes chanteuses préférées Demi Lovato :)﻿
FAT.﻿
Hello lisa﻿
Demi ha una voce magica♥﻿
Question.
Why is This Still in the top Ten on the YouTube Charts.
It's been since December YouTube.
Frozen is Dead.﻿
Let it go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
Okay like literally everyone chill. This is the original song and Disney 
modified it to fit the movie. ﻿
es una cancion hermosa vean su letra *dedicado﻿
Ok everybody i personaly think if someone thinks Let it go was from Demi 
Lovato then you can totally think that. Beacause i do as well.  If you dont 
like Demi you dont have to you can like Indina Menzel's verison. Im sorry 
if i spelled that wrong D:.  Anyway there is no reason to carry on this 
fight if there was  a solution about 4 5 months ago.? Calling Demi stupid 
and fat is not very nice. Because you would want to be treated niceley. 
Then dont call someone else stupid and fat. Thankyou for reading my coment 
if you did. Bye.

It's common known that every single person only this planet got fans and 
haters ﻿
she is so fat since the HSM :(( ﻿
haters here be like: DEMIS' FAT SHES UGLY SHE USES AUTOTUNE I HOPE SHE DIES 
BLAH BLAH
while im here like: i love you Demi, your amazing

Why hate? are you even gonna accomplish anything? Are you even gonna earn 
prizes for hating the most? are those hates even will come true like "i 
wish she dies"? no ok no. your not in a episode of genie or whatever where 
you make wish and will come true. pff.﻿
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooo﻿

For those individuals projecting their anger and self hatred onto others: 
Causing emotional discomfort to others and lowering their self esteem by 
sending such hateful messages will not make you feel better about yourself. 
For a second it may, however, over time you will realise that it is only 
causing yourself to become the person you most dread. Demi does not 'steal' 
songs, she was kindly asked to produce a slightly different version of it. 
Her vocals are amazing and she is an incredible person; although not 
everyone will have the same opinion as me, respect these artist and other 
people around you. That will get you a lot further in life than putting 
them down and laughing at others misfortune. 

I hope you have an awesome day! (:﻿

i am always perplexed why everyone readily accepts little girls that sing 
through a pitch shifter as someone with actual vocal chops… idina menzel 
doesn't have to do this … this girl is simply another manufactured 
"product"… (and i'm not just talking out of the side of my mouth… i am an 
audio engineer for 27 years … and a paid musician since 11…) … so i'm just 
very disappointed now how musical mediocrity to no talent seems to be 
easily embraced …and as far as believing that this hack wrote this song (as 
if it wasn't handed to her) you, have to be delusional...﻿
IN MY OPINION SHE SINGS IT BETTER THAN IDINA MENZEL ﻿
I luv Demi! But... She got fatter no offence. I mean just a few yrs ago, 
she was dancing, and was so skinny. Now, she is fatter. MNO OFFENSE ﻿

Yaaaaaaaaaaay!﻿
Idina Menzel Is better﻿
Qqn aurait la traduction exacte en français svp???﻿

changing notes, not in the proper range, changed lyrics, changed format... 
this is awful :/ 0/10﻿
Demiii i love you!!!You are my idol and my little angel!!Let it gooo Let it 
goooooo the cold never bothered me anywayyyy!!﻿
I LOVE this song!!!!!!﻿
The reason that Demi sang this song is because Frozen didn't get a lot of 
publicity at the beginning and when Demi sang this song everyone started 
watching Frozen. So no she didn't copy their song, she was the reason why 
you even heard of Frozen.﻿
<3﻿
Nothing personal, but think you're auto-tuned enough? This is a passionate 
song about deep feelings and shit, hearing this obvious auto-tune detracts 
in my opinion.﻿
Have people gotten meaner?﻿
Why does everyone have to hate so much. If you like the music that's great, 
leave your comments on it, if you don't first of all why are you even 
listening to it and secondly if you don't like it that's fine just keep it 
to yourself or at the very least make CONSTRUCTIVE criticism and don't just 
go trashing the music, Demi, or the fans. ﻿

The song just feels like it's missing something without the "let the storm 
rage on" parts. Sort of a weird choice to omit that, even if they weren't 
certain she could nail that final note. Still a pleasant rendition. ﻿
Love u demi it is amazing cover: )
Thanxxxx xoxoxo: D all love u ❤❤﻿

What they're like in front of the camera is I'm sure really different than 
when the camera's not there.﻿
Love it send me one﻿
She just sucks. She just sucks at singing so much. Her voice is so thin and 
weak, she can barely sing comfortably inside one octave and has no creative 
tendencies what so ever. Why is she still doing this? Why do people listen 
to this? How is she making money? She isn't even attractive. She's gives 
off the ditzy dumb girl vibe too. There is nothing redeeming about her. 
Stop idolizing this girl, its a waste of everybody's time.﻿

Let it go let I go can,t hold it back any more let it go let it go turn

easy to hear that she's better but still i'd like to hear her sing that 
song in the presence of 2014 or 2015. ﻿
Hell yes. I love Demi Lovato, been a fan of her music since 2009.﻿
What  a fucking beg﻿
The decision to release a single for "Let It Go" was made after the song 
was written and was presented to Disney. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert 
Lopez selected American singer and former Disney Channel star Demi Lovato, 
who also appears on Disney's Hollywood Records roster, to cover the song on 
the soundtrack album.

Anderson-Lopez said that Lovato was chosen because of the singer's own 
personal life; "She had a past that she's pretty open about that is similar 
to Elsa's journey of letting a dark past and fear behind and moving forward 
with your power." Lovato indeed identified herself with the song's context, 
stating "It's so relatable. Elsa is finding her identity; she's growing 
into who she is and she's finally accepting her own strength and magical 
powers. Instead of hiding it, like she's done all her life, she's letting 
it go and embracing it."

Lovato's cover version was released as a single by Walt Disney Records on 
October 21, 2013.

To all those who think Demi 'stole' the song. Let's clear it up ONCE AND 
FOR ALL.﻿

In terms of Let It Go being sung in English, I think I actually prefer the 
Demi Lovato version over the Idina Menzel version. That said, the French 
version Libérée, Délivrée is much better and much more poetic in my opinion.

Either way, it's still an awesome song!﻿

No offence but I much prefer Idina Menzel version. I find this version has

notes that Idina Menzel can.﻿

I actually prefer this version of the song. Idina Menzel is a great singer, 
no doubt there, but I just didn't believe her as Elsa. Her voice just 
sounds too mature for a 21 year old. I know I'm in the minority with that 
opinion, but yeah, her voice was a bit too seasoned and rich with life 
experience for such a young princess.﻿
Demi daha güzel söylüyor <3﻿
Let it go let it go.﻿
hahah stop making me laugh .. :D﻿
* Meant To Say that Disney Gave Her Permission To Sing This Song That Was 
Writing By A Husband & Wife For This Movie But In A Different Pop Version 
Of The Original One.﻿
Thanks Demi I smashed my iPad on the floor because of this song.






Just kidding﻿
It's a beutiful ﻿
First time in forever is such a better song.﻿

FROZEN﻿
i like this version better than Idina's version because it seems so much 
more natural. The "broadway" feeling the original song gives me makes it 
come off as really cheesy. And its kind of run into the ground. But it's 
disney. What do you expect?﻿
To everyone that's commenting rude things: You're all just jealous! She can 
sing WAY better than Idina Menzel. Plus she the most inspiring singer (to

Why is everyone hating on Demi, because the writers and producers of Frozen 
let her make Let it go her own. There's no reason for it, Demi is loved by 
so many people so your hate isn't going to affect her. So get your stupid

Cuando atacan los haters a Demi por su físico, es porque no tienen nada que 
decir se su voz. Seamos realistas, la voz de Demi Lovato es una de las 
mejores en el mercado musical en estos momentos. Puede que guste más la 
versión de Idina Menzel (A mi me encanta) pero eso no te da pie a meterte 
con esta artista, que es una de las pocas que merece la pena seguir hoy en 
día. Fin.﻿

I love how all these people are talking crap on her. She is a great singer 
why don' t you try to sing this song or any of her songs or others better 
and with such passion that she has. Leave her alone and go get a life 
instead of hating her cause she is singing a song that from a movie. You 
guys are acting like she claimed it as her own song.﻿

Love this song﻿
This has a much greater meaning than her just writing a song for a movie 
people! If you listen to the lyrics closely you can connect how Demi's life 
connects to this song. I think Demi's version and Elsa's were equally 
great. Although some parts in Demi's version would've went better in 
Elsa's. I love this song either way.﻿

demi. ﻿

It makes me extremely sad, when I read all the hate in here.
1. Demi didn't steal the song, this version is played during the credits. 
She's just singing the 'pop-version'.
2. If you call this fat, then I'm sorry how society have raised you. 
3. If you think this is auto tune, then please take three minutes out if 
your lives, to hear this live. Demi is actually one of the artists who 
sings beautifully.

Frozen è un film carino, ma di certo nn merita tutto il successo che  ha 
avuto, è un classico film dove cantano per allungarlo fino a raggiungere 
l'oretta e mezza; ci sono canzoni valide o comunque orecchiabili, ma la 
maggior parte sono canzoni stupide e senza senso. Non capisco come questo 
film abbia avuto un tale successo mentre Ralph spaccatutto no, nonostante 
quest'ultimo ha una idea di base molto più geniale.
La cosa bella è che il mio commento è in italiano, quindi nessuno lo 
leggerà. ﻿
cutie ^^﻿
Wow, can't people do a little research these days before running their 
mouths? Kristen and Robert lopez are the songwriters. There are two 
versions of the song, a show tune version song by the movie's star and a 
pop version song by demi. The pop version is song during the closing 
credits. ﻿

hey everyone, i did some research, and i know what power elsa has, its a 
real super human ability called "cryokinesis", but the power dosen let u 
build like ice dresses, or ice castles, nor anything elsa can do, all 
cryokinesis dose is freezes items, its a part of the very famous power 
psychokinesis or telekinesis "the ability to move objects with the mind" 
like, (i think this is how it goes) like psychokinesis, focus hard enough, 
then an item can freeze, also, it DOSE freeze water, but, its not like else 
were u have to wear gloves all the time u just focus to freeze something..

and there are other powers in the telekinesis (psychokinesis) category


psychokinesis (move objects)

pyrokinesis (burn or ignite objects)

hydrokinesis (effect move water)

sonokinesis (effects sound)

atmokinesis (create weather by emotion, like, happy sunny, nervous high 
winds or cloudy, and angry creates normal, or severe thunder storms, 
tornadoes, and hurricanes)

aerokinesis (create or effect wind)

magnokinesis (effect or move metal objects like cars, bars, etc)

geokinesis (effect or move earth like materials like dirt, grass, stone, 
etc)

chronokinesis (make time go reverse, slower, faster, or even stop it)

biokinesis (effect, or heal human body)

chlorokinesis (contact or effect plant like materials)

optikinesis (effect peoples eyes, or make them hallucinate)

electrokinesis (effect electricity or sock people with it




thats all the powers i know thats in that category, and what they do.... :)

🚨🚨Disney paid Demi to do this song. She didn't steal it from them. At the 
end of the movie It shows behind the scenes of her singing this song and 
they even play it when they roll the credits. ﻿

Yeah, you don't like her because she is not naked in this video, but you 
like nicki minaj, don't you?! Demi is such an amazing singer who has best 
songs and I really enjoy when I listen to her music! But, people are 
stupid, they just watch video like anaconda, they don't listen to music. So 
sick.﻿
This song is great!   but if you have something "bad" to share why dont you 
keep it foryour selves -_-

http://youtu.be/kHue-HaXXzg﻿
Umm she didn't composed the song she was just asked to sing it for the 
outro of the movie... She sounds great but I think the song was meant to be 
song more slowly and calm like idina Menzel (the original singer ) sings 
it. It makes the song sound soo much powerful and beautiful! ﻿
