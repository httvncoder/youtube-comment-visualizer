Did Backstreet Boys sue Justin Bieber for using same title of this song?﻿
Backstreet Boys - As Long As You Love Me  ﻿
As a non English song listener back in the 90s,
This probably be the very first English song that made me listen to English 
music. Still loving it.﻿
My feels﻿
None
I don't care who you are or where you're from, or what you did
Just as long as you love me.
For You My Love ﻿
Brian's eyes at 1.25....﻿
AS LONG AS U LOVE ME:  A stunning track that is majestic in it's total 
acceptance of love as the pinnacle of our existence.  It fired up the 90's 
charts and remains one of my favourites. The well moulded track makes an 
unconditional declaration of love: "Don't care what is written in your 
history. As long as you're here with me. I don't care who you are, Where 
you're from. What you did. As long as you love me". ﻿
for My Lovely +Mahmudah El Gumeri with backstreet boys - as long as you 
love me﻿
yes...whatever you are...i don't care it
i love you 
i will always love you darling﻿
My favourite <33 ﻿

These boys were so GOOD i am 28 gay male and all of the boy bands of the 
90"s were so so sexy and good at what they did, ,

thing thanks to trash music (and video clips) overwhelming the media.﻿

Like honestly put this next to an nsync video, or anything they've done in

for his very young age.....very amazing...﻿
So gay that it should be.........

I don´t care how brut you are
Gay or not

To some of you fucken haters that hate justin bieber theni just got one 
thing to rell why do you listen to backstreetboys aslong as you love me 
when you hate the artists thst sang as long as you love me from justin 
bieber it's practically the same name of rhe song you dumb fucks so shut up 
and get a life﻿
Backstreet Boys - As Long As You Love Me: época boa﻿
What the fuck justin fever is just a kid come guys he's little fucked up 
look at his mother look at her why this kid is so fuck up ﻿
super super super ﻿
If you search in You Tube, 'As long as you love me' , there are more 
results from the song of Justin Bieber than the Backstreetboys... This is 
so sad...﻿
aj had the best voice﻿
I am a Brazilian fan of backstreet boys; are the best﻿
Still better than 1D and 5SOS.﻿
nice!! ﻿
I genuinely love the backstreet boys, and im a 22 year old dude. My friends 
make fun of me for it, but honestly, how is this not good music?  I have 
just as much respect for the Backstreet Boys as I do The Temptations.  They 
didn't write their music either, neither did Sinatra, doesn't mean they 
aren't talented.  They are incredibly good singers, and these are excellent 
songs.  But just because so many girls like them, if your a dude and you 
like them, you're automatically labeled a faggot.  BACKSTREET FOR LIFE.﻿

Boybands nowadays got NOTHING on the Backstreet Boys. "thats what makes you 
beautiful mi mi mimmimi" wtf man... i mean... JUST COMPARE IT TO THIS. 
Seriously, what do they have on Backstreet's Back; Larger than Life; Shape 
of my Heart; Show me the meaning of being lonely; I Want it That Way; We've 
got it going on; As Long as you love me; Incomplete; Drowning; The Call; I 
COULD STAY HERE ALL NIGHT..﻿

Every time I watch this I remember a 7 or 8 year old (a former friend's 
little brother) performing the chair routine from this video in his living 
room. It was hysterical... funny what sticks with you, I was 15. If I had 
to choose a little brother in this world... :)  ﻿

This song is becoming VERY addicting, Oh my goodness
This song reminds me of my younger days!
Hay.good
The outfits were so colorful back then. :)﻿
When they made this video, someone cheered and said to Brian : "Go, B-rok 
go, B-rok, its your birthday..

Hahahaha﻿
LOl how could they still look handsome in those outfits? I bet if I wear 
this kind of outfit it will make me looks worse. ﻿
Another great hit from Backstreet Boys. Also if you think I should feature 
Backstreet or Nsync for "Neutral Nineties" tomorrow, let me know in the

AMO ESTE VIDEO ♥♥ ﻿
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leavin' my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
And how you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me

Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (I don't know)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me (yeah)

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah)
As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me﻿
I see love in the previous comments so rare in this days....﻿

This one is dedicated to my 1 and only true love. My baby Heidi, as long as 
you love me I will take care of you. I've always given you money when you 
needed it and my comfort and care as well, but I wish I was a millionaire 
because you deserve even more. You were there for me when times were hard 
for me when others weren't and that is why I will be there for you for the 
rest of my life and give you everything that you want. I love you honey 
with all my heart, as long as you love me....﻿

justin(o) alias: alcoholico, drogadicto,manejar sin lincencia y un tipo 
realmente asqueroso¨briaguer cometio un sacrilegio al poner el mismo nombre 
de esta hermosa canción a una de sus horrendas canciones. ¿Que opinan?﻿
Este tema lo escuchaba cuando iba a la preparatoria...vaya que 
recuerdos....﻿
always favourite! since i was a little kid! cool..﻿
These guys need to raise their standards..﻿

Really aint a boyband fan but Backstreet Boys genuinely had some very 
catchy songs!﻿
None
best song ever,,,,it bring me back childhood﻿
Man, when this came out, I hate it and all music at that time so much. I 
wished things could be more like the 70's, when Music Was Awesome. Now as 
much time as passed between now and then as did between then and the 70's, 
and that is messed. Up.

tl;dr Getting old sucks, kids.﻿

Anche se la solitudine è sempre stato un mio amico
Sto lasciando la mia vita nelle tue mani
La gente dice che sono pazzo e che io sono cieco
Rischiando il tutto in un colpo d'occhio
E come hai fatto a me cieco è ancora un mistero
Non riesco a farti uscire dalla mia testa
Non importa ciò che è scritto nella vostra storia
Fino a quando sei qui con me
Chorus:
Non mi importa chi sei
Da dove vieni
Quello che hai fatto
Finché mi ami
Chi sei
Da dove vieni
Non mi importa quello che hai fatto
Finché mi ami
Ogni piccola cosa che hai detto e fatto
Sente come se fosse dentro di me
Non importa se siete in fuga
Sembra che siamo destinati ad essere
Coro
Ponte:
Ho cercato di nasconderlo in modo che nessuno sa
Ma credo che si vede
Quando si guarda negli occhi
Quello che hai fatto e dove si sono comin 'da
Non mi importa, purché tu mi ami, baby.
Coro
Chi sei
Da dove vieni
Non mi importa quello che hai fatto
Finché mi ami﻿

The video makes no SENSE﻿

Better than justine fuckin' bieber!﻿
This is so sweet. When you're young, you just like it because it's The BSB 
and they're cute and have nice music... But when you're older, you really 
listen to what they say and it's so deep. "I don't care where you're from, 
what you did... As long as you love me" ... If only more real men believed 
this. ❤️﻿

Howie Dorough was my first celebrity boyfriend haha I was like 8﻿
25,497,437 views of this video since 25 may 2011.HAhahahahaha!!!
That's Twenty Five Million, Four Hundred Ninety Seven Thousand, Four 
Hundred Thirty Seven Views for a song released by the Backstreet Boys in 
1997. That just blows my mind!
Yes, I am now just one of those people but I am a 26 year old dude on a 
nostalgia trip. I doubt that 25,497,437 views are simply a whole lot of 
dudes on some weird drunken nostalgia trip so I can say (without accepting 
any ridicule from fuckhead trolls) Wow! These guys had a lot more influence 
on society and continue to get a lot more views than I ever thought 
possible!﻿
The nostalgia is real.﻿

Aaron Carter was so fine back in the day. I had to argue with my wife over 
giving my son the same hair cut as him now that his hair is long enough. My 
wife is racist against music even if that is not a real thing. She likes 
Rock music. Sigh it's a democracy about the types of music people listen 
to. Why can't we all just get along.﻿

Never been a fan of boy band. But they are one of the icons of the 90s. And

Who the fuck is Justin Bieber?﻿
Duck outta here with comparing the gods of boy bands with that little 
faggot Justin beiber. BSB was and still is the most successful boy band who 
STILL sells out areas to this day and have remained relevant for over 16 
years. That's crazy and they deserve respect. 
They were around before YouTube, social media, pretty much the internet how 
we know it, and were crazy popular. Bet you can ask any 20 year old who BSB 
is and they will remember. 1D hasn't got shit on these guys either. They 
learned from the best. ﻿
musica muy buena nsync﻿
1673 people are lil Wayne's fan.
﻿
So sad that people try to compare them with one direction... Those people 
are crazy as hell!﻿
Vale, me acabo de enamorar.﻿
I never seen the music video until now XD ﻿
I love it and my 8 year old daughter adores it! Positive thoughts and

Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine 
Yalnızlık her zaman dostum olmuşsa da 

I'm leaving my life in your hands 
Hayatımı ellerine bırakıyorum şu anda 

People say I'm crazy and that I am blind 
İnsanlar deli ve kör diyorlar bana 

Risking it all in a glance 
Bir bakışta her şeyi riske atınca 

And how you got me blind is still a mystery 
Ve nasıl gözlerimi kör ettiğin bir sır hala 

I can't get you out of my head 
Seni atamıyorum kafamdan 

Don't care what is written in your history 
Geçmişinde ne olduğu önemli değil 

As long as you're here with me 
Benimle olduğun sürece burada 

Chorus: 
I don't care who you are 
Umurumda değil kim olduğun 

Where you're from 
Nerden olduğun 

What you did 
Ne yaptığın 

As long as you love me 
Beni sevdiğin sürece 

Who you are 
Kimsin 

Where you're from 
Nerelisin 

Don't care what you did



Ne yaptın mühim değil 

As long as you love me 
Beni sevdiğin sürece 


Every little thing that you have said and done 
Söylediğin ve yaptığın her küçük şey 

Feels like it's deep within me 
İçimde derinleşiyor sanki 

Doesn't really matter if you're on the run 
Eğer kaçıyorsan önemi yok 

It seems like we're meant to be 
Birlikte olmalıyız çünki 

Chorus 

Bridge: 
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows 
Saklamaya çalıştım ki kimse bilmesin 

But I guess it shows 
Ama sanırım belli oluyor 

When you look into my eyes 
Gözlerime baktığında 

What you did and where you are comin' from 
Ne yapmış olduğun ve nerden olduğun 

I don't care, as long as you love me, baby. 
Umurumda değil, beni sevdiğin sürece bebeğim 

Chorus 

Who you are 
Kimsin 

Where you're from 
Nerelisin 

Don't care what you did 
Ne yaptın mühim değil 

As long as you love me 
Beni sevdiğin sürece

That Latina girl is Blue Bloods' Detective Baez.﻿
i accidentally come to know this song when i was 8
dammn it's been 10 years already...;;﻿
I wish there were female versions of the Backstreet Boys karaoke. Max Marin 
is my inspiration in writing lyrics and the Backstreet Boys are my 
inspiration in singing. I miss the 90's﻿
nick why would you come here in cebu,phlippines, you are so cute.......i 
think im gonna die of your cuteness!﻿
I feel nostalgic. ﻿
cant believe that was 17 years ago looks pretty modern﻿
i love.... =)﻿
None
fofo﻿
Nice~
﻿
Classic. Nothing can compare. Backstreet Boys forever as long as we love 
them.﻿
I was born 2 years before this. But I remember their music because my 
sister was a huge fan of them. This was a good boyband (and Nsync etc), I'm 
not against 1D and the now popular 'boy bands', but they don't have the 
emotion to tell a story by singing like these boys had.﻿
te hermoso﻿
as long as you love me :3 :')﻿
THIS IS LOVE: feel it﻿
i was 2 days ago at backstrees's show. like always - great and cute...﻿
The blond doods haircut is so 90's﻿
This song was my moms fave and now its mine!!!﻿
Back then...I used to have a huge celebrity crush on Nick Carter!!﻿
Anyone who hates on "The Backstreet Boys" is just a hater. They were real 
and they had good songs, unlike most today. Dudes who dislike them and 
jealous, girls who dislike them haven't really listened to them. People can 
hate all they want, that do dent take away the fact that they had talent. 
You can say they ripped off other "black artists", whatever that means. 
They still did what the did very well, and I'm a black guy who listens to 
2Pac mostly. ﻿
I LOVE BSB AND 1D LET ME BE OKAY GREAT﻿
No me importaria nada, siempre y cuando me amaras!! ﻿
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like its deep within me
Doesn't really matter you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be﻿
wtf was that Kimberly from The Pussycat dolls? 2:48 ﻿

Love this song ever. Wanna See How much i love this song? Type in Lucky

shit....but nowadays i actually appreciate the good music﻿

Troppo bella! Le ragazzine si accalcavano, ovunque loro fossero!!﻿
@Sophia Styles No 1D arent and they will never be better than BSB, they 
have many views big deal it doesnt define yor talent, if Youtube existed 
when this was released 1D wouldnt even be close to half the views, and 
their fan base is like 10-16 year old girls? And everytime you say you dont 
like something from 1D or criticise them they will try to kill you, I once 
said i didnt like 1Ds songs and they just started bitching saying I was 
jealous, lol why should I be jealous of 1D when I listen to BSB?﻿
I dont care who you are, where you from, AS LONG AS YOU LOVE ME! <3 xD
2013 like 
I got messi ads....
Like i've said they are the best singers and boybands compare this 
generation like justin b. i hate this guy fuck! 1D im not against of them 
but theyre not the best :)
They're MV is so good, wholesome and the dance moves are awesome its only 
BSB
I was born in 1999 and I completely agree with you.
I think Ayesha is trying to make a generalization. Face it, most people 
born 1997 ++ don't really know BSB.
i love you nick :)
Eita saudade matadora!!! :)
I may have been to young, but in 02 when i was four years old i remember 
listening to N*Sync's album Celebrity, I couldn't get enough and my mom 
would always play BSB as well when i was four thats how i know them and 
remember them. I still listen to them because i know good music when i hear 
it. 1D i can't stand them they make my ears bleed im glad that i still 
listen to this kind of music and i think teens these days should do the 
same as well cause this is real music!
N'SYNC = BackStreetBoys.Don't compare both awesome. Both group is better 
than 1D -.-
Saudade define
Justin who? One Wath?....Please .... 
Justin beiber copied:(
Haha bien chido peroyo tengo 7años ??? quiensabe no jajajajjajajajja
LOL *falls off chair laughing*
muito boa essa musica lindaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
I see Bruno Mars sing this song. What do you guys think?
I feel sory for you. Something clearly must be wrong with you either 
physically or mentally if you can claim that bullshit only becuase one girl 
told what was she thinking about it. Respect her taste, Jesus.
que tiempos, con 7 añicos
love this song alot! and i also love the ppl who loves this song!﻿
As Long As You Love Me﻿

Oh♥Good

OMG, my husband loves the backstreet boys but everytime i bring it up in 
front of people he says he doesnt!
BSB 1997 Song: As Long As You Love Me JB 2012 Song: As Long As You Love Me 
... Now come on..
most appealing in this video 1 nick 2 aj 3 kevin 4 brian 5 howie
makes you wanna sing it to that special someone lol
Except JB was still swiming in his father balls when this track was 
released. And also, speaking of Boys Bands, Back Street boys were the most 
successful EVER. They were a worldwide phenomenon respected by all. Up 
until this day idiots try to copy their concept and all failed miserably. I 
am a 33 yo guy and i have no shame to say that i was a fan of the BB. And i 
am surprising myself listening them today and finding that they were SO 
MUCH BETTER than any of the sort after them.
I'm 00's child and I'm 10 now but I love Backstreet boys
Explain to me how this is sad. I dont like certain music big deal. Why am I 
being smacked for this? I have my opinions. 
Word!
Such an amazing song x
