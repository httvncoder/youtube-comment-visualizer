youtube-comment-visualizer
==========================

A data visualization project for CS 467 - Social Visualization by Vinh Ha, Julia LaBelle, Zoe Lu, Paninadra Seetharamu, and William Xie.

The theme of the assignment is to visualize some form of collective communication. We decided to visualize YouTube comments - specifically the positive and negative sentiment of music video comments of different music genres.

We decided to analyze the music videos:

- Baby - Justin Bieber
- As Long As You Love Me - Backstreet Boys
- All About That Bass - Meghan Trainor
- Let It Go - Frozen

For data collection, we manually collected a total of 200 YouTube comments for each video and ran the collection of comments through [a word analysis tool](http://www.textfixer.com/tools/online-word-counter.php). We then took the top most frequent words and ran them through a sentiment analysis tool. The overall sentiment of the collection of comments was also taken.
